Job Board - README

Overview
A simple job board application to post, search, and apply for jobs. Designed as a starting point for building a full-featured jobs marketplace with REST API and a lightweight web UI.

Core Features
- Job posting: title, company, location, remote flag, salary range, description, tags
- Job search and filtering by title, company, location, tags, remote
- Job details and apply link/email
- Basic authentication for employers (register, login) to manage postings
- Public read-only endpoints for job listings
- Optional admin UI for moderation

Technical Notes
- Backend: RESTful API (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Ruby/Sinatra, or similar)
- Data store: Relational (Postgres) or document (MongoDB)
- Frontend: Static SPA (React/Vue) or server-rendered templates
- Auth: JWT or session-based auth for employers and admins
- Deployment: Docker + compose, or cloud (Heroku/GCP/Azure)
